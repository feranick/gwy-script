GSVN-Mac

This script is for OS X, and it uses a combination of MacPorts an upstream project to manage 
the installation of various version of Gyddion (stable, development versions...).   

The script requires macports and Xcode to be installed. It has a menu with
the following choices:

1. Install latest development snapshot
2. Install latest stable from macports
3. Install latest stable from upstream
4. Cleanup previous builds

The script automatically check for the latest versions (svn, macports,
upstream). In the case of svn, it also makes a dmg package that can be
ported to other OS X machines.
